This project is my solution to the final challenge from Kevin Powell **Conquering Responsive Layouts** course. The goal was to build the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size that closely matches the provided design.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

### Mobile-First Approach

- Designed and built starting from mobile devices
- Progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Media queries using `min-width` for scalability
- Responsive mobile navigation with hamburger button

### Layout structure

- **Container Components**: Maximum width containers with proper spacing
- **Flexbox Layouts**: For flexible component arrangements
- **Percentage-based-widths**: Using `%` for fluid layout
- **Relative Units**: using `em` for scalable padding/margins

### CSS Methodology

- **BEM Naming**: `Block__Element--Modifier` syntax for maintainability
- **Utility Classes**: Reusable helper classes for common patterns
